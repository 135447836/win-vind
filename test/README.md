# win-vind Test 

## Plan

This is based on branch coverage.

Only the common code test have been completed. However, each binding is not sufficient.

By the way, the Windows API mock only supports MinGW.

## Status

- core
  - time (✔)
  - util (✔)
  - bind
  - coreio
  - io
  - key
  - opt

- wxgui
