# FAQ

If you have some questions, please send me.

### Why is the name win-vind?  
win-vind means for **win**dows **vi**m key b**ind**er.  
<br>
### Why is **o** a right click and **a** is a left click?  
I regarded original-Vim's operation for changing from Normal to Insert (e.g. **i**, **o**, **a**) as the aiming the caret position. Therefore I adopted these commands for deciding mouse positions. Additionaly, **o** is also adopted as the decide key in my favorite Vim plugins like **NERDTree**.  
<br>
### What is the GUI visual mode?  
It is the same as holding the mouse left pressing.  
<br>
### I want to use **Alt** + **Tab**.
Please use <a href="https://pit-ray.github.io/win-vind/cheat_sheet/window_ctrl/#switch-window">Switch Window</a>.  
<br>
### Would it be possible to start without key-bindings and be turn on win-vind whenever my wants?
Yes. You should set **GUI Insert** at **Preferences/settings/Initial Mode**.
